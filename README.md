## DFS Traversal with Obstacles
This project is an interactive web application that allows users to visually perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal on a 20x20 grid. Users can set a start point, an end point, and add obstacles to the grid. The DFS algorithm will then compute and highlight the path from the start to the end point, avoiding any obstacles.

## Features
- 20x20 Interactive Grid: Clickable cells where you can set start, end, and obstacle points.
- DFS Path Visualization: Displays the path computed by the DFS algorithm between the start and end points.
- Obstacle Placement: Add obstacles to the grid, and the DFS algorithm will find a path around them.
- Reset Grid: Clear the entire grid to start over.

## Technologies Used
- Frontend: ReactJS
- Backend: Golang
